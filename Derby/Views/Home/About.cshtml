    <h1>Derby</h1>
    <p class="lead">A <em>free</em> community tool for managing Pinewood Derby competitions</p>
</div>
<div>The goal of the application is to provide a community system for multiple packs and regions to use. The program was born out of frustration from having to use multiple Excel spreadsheets to manage a derby.</div>
<div>You can <a href="https://github.com/tmeers/Derby">check out the source code</a>, log issues, and contribute to the application on GitHub</div>

<ul>
    <li>Create and manage multiple packs </li>
    <li>Manage scouts across years, not tied down to a single den</li>
    <li>Create additional "dens" for leaders and friends &amp; family races</li>
    <li>Pack privacy for a "members only" use, only your pack sees your scouts and competitions</li>
    <li>
        Competitions are completed per den in a scheduled scheduled method

    <ul>
        <li>Race Heats will be designed around the number of lanes and racers, each racer racing in a different lane with each heat</li>
        <li>Heats will be scheduled to avoid racers competing against the same racer repeatedly </li>
        <li>
        The Heats will follow a <a href="http://www.rahul.net/mcgrew/derby/methods.html#chaotic">"Chaotic-Rotation Method"</a><br>
