Derby
=====
A community tool for managing Pinewood Derby and Raingutter Regatta races. The goal of the application is to provide a community system for multiple packs and regions to use. The program was born out of frustration from having to use multiple Excel spreadsheets to manage a derby. 

Features
=====
  - Create and manage multiple packs 
  - Manage scouts across years, not tied down to a single den
  - Create additional "dens" for leaders and friends & family races
  - Pack privacy for a "members only" use, only your pack sees your scouts and competitions
  - Competitions are completed per den in a scheduled round robin method
    - Race Heats will be designed around the number of lanes and racers, each racer racing in a different lane with each heat
    - Heats will be scheduled to avoid racers competing against the same racer repeatedly 
    - The Heats will follow the [Stearns-Borom Method](http://www.wtrfrd.com/pack339/339stern.htm)

Pack Membership
=====
Invite other pack members to be a part of the fun and watch a competition as a guest, contributor, or an owner. Bye default all packs are locked down to only people that are invited to join.
